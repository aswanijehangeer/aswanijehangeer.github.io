A recent statistics graduate with over two years of experience as a freelance R Shiny developer.

My job consists of helping researchers and companies to analyze and visualize their datasets. I am skilled for most data-science steps: data pre-processing, application of statistical methods, data visualization, shiny dashboards, and machine learning.

I'm a quick learner, always trying to improve. I've developed skills in web development and am learning Rust. üî•

I'm passionate about chess and continuously working to enhance my skills in the game. ‚ôüÔ∏è
